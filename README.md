# Things you may be wondering:
## Do I need this extension?
I don't know ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Do you have to copy and paste things, and find it annoying having to search for it everytime? Me too \*high five\*. 
Perhaps you just need to use "Lorem ipsum" a lot of times... this extension may be useful to you.

## What can I do with this?
In my tests, 5 paragraphs of Lorem ipsum in a single input worked just fine. 
Japanese hiragana, katakana and kanji also performed very well, so was the Cyrillic alphabet.
I didn't test any other alphabet :/
It uses SQLite 3, so, theoretically, it can handle an input of 1 billion characters but I didn't go that far to test it, keep that in mind.

## I have found a bug.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Feel free to report it in "Issues" section, but I just need you to keep mind that my programming skills are just like my art skills: almost nonexistent. So it might take a while before I can solve it (if I'm able to do so. Please root for me).

## Why, in Merlin's name, did you do this extension?
Well... it all started because I like to use this emoticon when chatting with my friends: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Even though it is possible to write it down using Unicode (and maybe changing my keyboard layout to Japanese), it is a considerable amount of work to do so.

Another way to do that was:
Opening a new tab in my browser, searching for "aquela carinha" ("that face" in Portuguese)* in Duck Duck Go or Google, finding the emoticon in results, selecting it with the mouse cursor, copying it after I was sure I selected it correctly....
I mean... that's another unnecessary amount of work, and I don't have enough RAM to keep opening more than 2 tabs on Chrome...

But none of those methods could be compared to coding an extension to Ulauncher in terms of amount of work. 
The moral of the story? I don't know ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
But, at least, if I need to use this emoticon, I can just press Ctrl + space bar, type "fst" and select the item I want. Way faster, easier *and RAM efficient* :)


\* "aquela carinha" actually refers to Lenny Face, not to " ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ "

## You call that garbage "code"?
"I'm not a real programmer, I just glue stuff together"
